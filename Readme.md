## The Test

We have the following API route:

```https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/sofar-eu-1/video_data.json```

We would like to see some code that takes this API route and imports it into a database. This database would allow us to then search via song name, artist or city.

We would like you to spend no more than a couple of hours on this task.

## Bonus points

 - Some kind of API route that can be used to query this data would be great
 - We would like to see your journey, so please use your git commits to tell us a story
 - We love TDD so some kind of test suite is a plus. We don't need a full test suite but some tests covering the important logic would be better
 - If you'd like to show off your front-end knowledge, you could create a view that shows the videos that have been imported.
 - If you can't achieve everything in the time use the readme to tell us what you would do next.

## Deliverables

Please clone this repository add some code and update the Readme with how to run your app and import.  

Then upload to somewhere like github or bitbucket (has free private repos) and share with us, or create a zip archive and send to us.
